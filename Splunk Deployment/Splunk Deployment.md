[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

## Splunk Enterprise (Linux)
```
# Install Splunk using RPM:
rpm -ivh splunk_package_name.rpm

# Install Splunk using Dpkg:
dpkg -i splunk_package_name.deb

# Install Splunk using Tar:
tar xvzf splunk_package_name.tgz -C /opt

# Enable Splunk to start on boot and accept the license:
/opt/splunk/bin/splunk enable boot-start -systemd-managed 1 -user splunk -group splunk --accept-license
```

## Splunkd.service
`nano /etc/systemd/system/Splunkd.service`

Add or change the values in the file:
```
LimitNOFILE=64000
LimitNPROC=16000
LimitDATA=8589934592
LimitFSIZE=infinity
TasksMax=8192
```
[Set limits using the /etc/systemd configuration files](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Troubleshooting/ulimitErrors#Set_limits_using_the_.2Fetc.2Fsystemd_configuration_files)
```
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart Splunkd.service
```

## Enable SSL
*   `nano /opt/splunk/etc/system/local/web.conf`
```text-plain
[settings]
max_upload_size = 1024
enableSplunkWebSSL = true
```

## Optimization Recommendations
In the [limits.conf](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/Limitsconf) file, consider reviewing and adjusting the following settings to optimize Splunk performance:
*   `nano /opt/splunk/etc/system/local/limits.conf`
```
[search]
base_max_searches = 10
max_searches_per_cpu = 6
```
These adjustments should be aligned with our system requirements and available resources.
*   `/opt/splunk/bin/splunk start`

## Forwarding Splunk's internal logs to the indexers
*    `nano /opt/splunk/etc/system/local/outputs.conf`
```
[tcpout] defaultGroup = default-autolb-group

[tcpout:default-autolb-group]
server = 192.168.1.50:9997

[tcpout-server://192.168.1.50:9997]
```

## Indexer Server
```

**Log Retention**

`mv /opt/splunk/etc/system/local/indexes.conf /opt/splunk/etc/system/local/indexes.conf.bkp`

`nano /opt/splunk/etc/system/local/indexes.conf`
```

# maxHotSpanSecs sets the maximum age of data in the "hot" bucket to 90 days.
maxHotSpanSecs = 7776000

# frozenTimePeriodInSecs sets the maximum age of data in the "cold" bucket to 275 days.
frozenTimePeriodInSecs = 23760000

Bucket States Overview
| Bucket State | Description | Searchable? |
|--------------|-------------|-------------|
| Hot          | New data is written to hot buckets. Each index has one or more hot buckets. | Yes         |
| Warm         | Buckets rolled from hot. New data is not written to warm buckets. An index has many warm buckets. | Yes         |
| Cold         | Buckets rolled from warm and moved to a different location. An index has many cold buckets. | Yes         |
| Frozen       | Buckets rolled from cold. The indexer deletes frozen buckets, but you can choose to archive them first. Archived buckets can later be thawed. | No          |
| Thawed       | Buckets restored from an archive. If you archive frozen buckets, you can later return them to the index by thawing them. | Yes         |

Default Index (defaultdb) Directory Structure
| Bucket State | Default Location                                       | Notes                                                                    |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Hot          | `$SPLUNK_HOME/var/lib/splunk/defaultdb/db/*`          | Each hot bucket occupies its own subdirectory.                            |
| Warm         | `$SPLUNK_HOME/var/lib/splunk/defaultdb/db/*`          | Each warm bucket occupies its own subdirectory.                           |
| Cold         | `$SPLUNK_HOME/var/lib/splunk/defaultdb/colddb/*`      | Each cold bucket occupies its own subdirectory. When warm buckets roll to cold, they get moved to this directory. |
| Frozen       | When buckets freeze, they get deleted or archived into a location that you specify. | Deletion is the default. See [Archive indexed data](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Indexer/Automatearchiving) for information on how to archive the data instead. |
| Thawed       | `$SPLUNK_HOME/var/lib/splunk/defaultdb/thaweddb/*`    | Buckets that are archived and later thawed reside in this directory. See [Restore archived data](http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Indexer/Restorearchiveddata) for information on restoring archived data to a thawed state. |
